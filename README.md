This C++ program implements a Red-Black Tree data structure. Red-Black Trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree, where each node has an extra bit to represent its color, either red or black, and it satisfies certain properties to ensure balanced operations.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Node Structure (`struct Node`):
   - Represents a node in the Red-Black Tree.
   - Contains data (an integer), pointers to the parent, left child, and right child nodes, and a color (0 for black, 1 for red).

2. RedBlackTree Class:
   - `private` members:
     - `root`: Pointer to the root node of the tree.
     - `TNULL`: Represents a null node in the tree, used as a sentinel node.
     - Various helper functions for tree traversal (`preOrderHelper`, `inOrderHelper`, `postOrderHelper`), search (`searchTreeHelper`), deletion (`deleteFix`, `rbTransplant`, `deleteNodeHelper`), and rotation (`leftRotate`, `rightRotate`).
   - `public` members:
     - Constructor initializes the tree with a null root.
     - Public functions for inserting (`insert`), searching (`searchTree`), deleting (`deleteNode`), and printing (`printTree`) elements of the tree, as well as traversing the tree in preorder, inorder, and postorder (`preorder`, `inorder`, `postorder`).
     - Additional functions like finding the minimum (`minimum`), maximum (`maximum`), successor (`successor`), and predecessor (`predecessor`) nodes in the tree.

3. Main Function:
   - Creates an instance of the RedBlackTree.
   - Inserts several elements into the tree.
   - Prints the tree structure before and after deleting a node.

4. Insertion:
   - Inserts a new node into the tree following the rules of a Red-Black Tree.
   - After insertion, it calls `insertFix` to restore the Red-Black Tree properties if violated.

5. Deletion:
   - Deletes a node from the tree while maintaining the Red-Black Tree properties.
   - After deletion, it calls `deleteFix` to restore the Red-Black Tree properties if violated.

6. Tree Rotation:
   - `leftRotate` and `rightRotate` functions are used for balancing the tree during insertion and deletion operations.

7. Color Flipping:
   - The color of the nodes is adjusted during insertion and deletion to maintain the Red-Black Tree properties.

8. Printing Tree Structure:
   - `printTree` function prints the structure of the Red-Black Tree with appropriate indentation to visualize the tree hierarchy.

Overall, the code demonstrates the implementation of a Red-Black Tree with basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
